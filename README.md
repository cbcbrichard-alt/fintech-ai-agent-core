## 📖 Overview

**Sanctuary Finance AI** is an intelligent discovery framework tailored for the North American financial ecosystem. By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, it distills complex financial data into actionable, compliant recommendations without ever requesting or storing sensitive user data (PII).

### Why Sanctuary?
- **Zero-PII Architecture**: We never ask for SSNs or bank credentials.
- **Intent-Driven**: Moving beyond static ads to contextual matching.
- **Compliance-Centric**: Hard-coded logic to adhere to FTC & CFPB regulations.
